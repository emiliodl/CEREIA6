* Status of tumor MMR/Microsatellite Instability: Participants can be screened based on local MMR/Microsatellite Instability testing results using immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or next generation sequencing (NGS) performed in a certified local laboratory, but participant eligibility needs to be determined by MMR IHC results. For participant with available local MMR IHC results for the respective cohort(s), tumor samples have to be submitted to a central IHC laboratory and its quality has to be checked and cleared prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). For participants without available local MMR IHC test results (participants with local PCR or NGS test results), central IHC results have to confirm eligibility prior to proceeding with other screening procedures.
